# SimpleJWT

A crude and basic REST implementaton that handles JWT (jsonwebtoken) using NuxtJS.

  - This uses MongoDB as for storing data like users and blacklisted tokens
  - NuxtJS was chosen for the reason that it can serve as backend or frontend, rather having separate node instances

### Installation
Open on directory then command:
```sh

$ npm run dev
```

  - Input sanitation
